2-8-2016 TODO
(higher numbers have greater priority)

1. more descriptive status messages while commands are being sent
2. increase maximum command delay from 20s
2.25 figure out the 'Parsed $N Channel' mystery
2.5 implement a 'global' button?
2.75 implement some means of sending a function over some time period
	- pseudo-solved by writing playfileGenerator class in java
2.75 set a maximum size on the command grid so it doesnt swallow the status text field
3. implement exit button (I think wxWidgets even has ID_EXIT defined that can be used) to ensure that
	the serial port is reset/closed before the application closes (rather than doing this in the destructor
	since the windows children have (?) already been deleted at that point
4. ESTOP/interrupt mechanism for serial while commands are being sent which will stop the thread (hint: need 
	to actually make this its own thread first) and then issue a reset command

data collection tests:
-keep one card at max while ramping up other cards (stability test)
-evaluate linear behavior (bidirectional)
-transition test (how fast does the h-bridge switch?)
-why is there a negative offset (from box?)
